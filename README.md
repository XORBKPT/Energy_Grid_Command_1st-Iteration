The game will launch in the Thonny serial console, displaying a welcome message and the initial grid state.
Gameplay Mechanics
As the Captain, your mission is to manage the energy grid across three quadrants over 80 turns (representing 20 years). Each quadrant contains four sectors, and you must deploy resources to keep them stable amidst growing demand and random events.

Quadrants and Sectors
Quadrant A: High Renewable Penetration
Sectors: A1, A2, A3, A4
Challenge: Fluctuations from solar and wind energy.
Resource: BESS (Battery Energy Storage Systems)
Quadrant B: Industrial Zone
Sectors: B1, B2, B3, B4
Challenge: High industrial demand.
Resource: BESS
Quadrant C: Residential Grid
Sectors: C1, C2, C3, C4
Challenge: EV-induced harmonic distortions.
Resource: Inverters
Resources
BESS (Quadrants A & B):
Capacity: 10 MW per unit
Cost: 0.015 billion EUR per unit
Inverters (Quadrant C):
Capacity: 10 MW per unit
Cost: 0.005 billion EUR per unit
Stability
Each sector has a required capacity that increases slightly each turn.
If the deployed capacity is less than the required capacity, the sector is unstable and has a 50% chance of causing a blackout each turn.
Blackouts deduct 1 billion EUR from your budget.
Random Events
There’s a 20% chance per turn that a random sector will experience an event, increasing its required capacity by 50% for that turn.
Budget and Turns
Starting Budget: 300 billion EUR
Turns: 80 (each turn represents 3 months)
Victory Condition: Survive 80 turns with a budget greater than 0 and fewer than 5 blackouts.
Defeat Conditions: Budget reaches 0 or below, or 5 or more blackouts occur.
How to Play
Start the Game:
The game begins with a welcome message and displays the initial state of the grid.
View the State:
Enter STATUS to see the current turn, budget, blackout count, and detailed sector information.
Deploy Resources:
Use the command DEPLOY [BESS|INVERTER] [SECTOR] [QUANTITY] to allocate resources.
Example: DEPLOY BESS A1 2 deploys 2 BESS units to sector A1.
End Your Turn:
Type END to complete your actions and advance to the next turn.
Monitor Stability:
After each turn, the game checks for unstable sectors and reports any blackouts.
Win or Lose:
Victory: Reach turn 80 with budget > 0 and < 5 blackouts.
Defeat: Budget ≤ 0 or ≥ 5 blackouts.

How Do Students Start a Serial Console?
The simplest and most recommended way for students to interact with a game on the Raspberry Pi Pico is by using the serial console built into Thonny, a popular Python IDE designed for beginners. Here’s how students can start it:

Set Up Thonny:
Ensure Thonny is installed on the school PCs (freely available at thonny.org).
Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the PC via a USB cable while holding the BOOTSEL button, then release it to enter bootloader mode. Thonny should detect the Pico automatically.
Configure Thonny for MicroPython:
Open Thonny.
Go to Tools > Options > Interpreter.
Select “MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)” from the dropdown menu and choose the correct port (e.g., COM3 on Windows). Click OK.
Write or Load the Game Code:
Write the game script in Thonny (or load an existing one), ensuring it uses MicroPython’s input() and print() functions for user interaction and output.
Save the script to the Pico (e.g., as main.py) by clicking File > Save As and selecting the Pico.
Run the Script and Open the Serial Console:
Click the green “Run” button (▶) in Thonny.
The serial console will automatically appear in the bottom “Shell” window of Thonny.
Students can now see the game’s output (e.g., prompts or messages) and type inputs directly into the Shell to interact with the game.
Why This Works Well:

Thonny’s serial console is designed for MicroPython development, making it seamless for both outputting game text and accepting student inputs.
It’s beginner-friendly and aligns with how students likely already program the Pico in a classroom setting.
No additional software or complex setup is needed beyond what’s already used for coding.
Can the Windows Terminal Pop Up and Interact Directly Instead?
You’re also wondering if it’s possible to have the Windows terminal (e.g., Command Prompt) pop up automatically and let students interact with the game from there, perhaps to simplify things on school PCs. Let’s explore this.

Is It Possible?
Yes, it’s technically possible to use the Windows terminal to interact with the Pico, but it requires extra steps and isn’t as straightforward as Thonny. Here’s how it could work:

Serial Communication:
The Pico communicates with the PC over a USB serial connection (a virtual COM port).
The game code on the Pico would still use print() for output and input() for user responses, sending and receiving data via this serial port.
Opening the Windows Terminal:
You could write a MicroPython script to make the Pico act as a USB HID (Human Interface Device) to send keystrokes (e.g., Win+R, “cmd”, Enter) to open Command Prompt automatically when plugged in. However, this is unreliable due to timing differences across PCs and isn’t a standard feature of MicroPython—it requires libraries like adafruit_hid.
Alternatively, students would manually open Command Prompt and connect to the Pico’s serial port (e.g., COM3).
Interacting via Command Prompt:
In Command Prompt, students could use a command like mode COM3: BAUD=115200 PARITY=N DATA=8 STOP=1 to configure the serial port, then use type COM3 to see output. However, sending input back to the Pico is trickier—Command Prompt isn’t designed for interactive serial communication like this.
A better option would be third-party serial terminal software (e.g., PuTTY or Tera Term), where students select the Pico’s COM port and baud rate (typically 115200) to interact with the game.
Challenges with This Approach
Complexity: Automatically opening the terminal via code adds significant complexity (e.g., HID emulation or custom PC-side scripts), which isn’t practical for beginners.
Manual Setup: Without automation, students must manually configure the terminal or install extra software, which could be a hassle on school PCs with restricted permissions.
Input/Output Handling: Command Prompt isn’t ideal for two-way serial communication, and third-party tools add another learning curve.
Is It Easier on School PCs?
Not really. While the idea of a familiar Windows terminal popping up sounds appealing, it introduces more setup steps and potential issues compared to Thonny:

School PCs might block software installations (e.g., PuTTY) or restrict Command Prompt access.
Thonny’s all-in-one solution (coding + serial console) is more consistent and requires less troubleshooting across different systems.
Recommendation for Students
For students, especially those new to programming, stick with Thonny’s serial console. It’s the easiest and most reliable way to start and interact with the game on the Raspberry Pi Pico:

Steps: Connect the Pico, run the script in Thonny, and use the Shell window to play.
Benefits: No extra tools, no complex code changes, and it keeps the focus on learning programming and game logic.
Using the Windows terminal directly is possible but not practical for a classroom setting. It requires either advanced coding (e.g., HID emulation) or additional software and manual configuration, which could frustrate students and teachers alike. Thonny keeps it simple and educational, making it the best choice for school PCs.
